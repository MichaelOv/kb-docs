# Builtin authentication

!!! example "Work in Progress"

Here we describe which login options are already integrated in i-doit.<br>
Login via the web interface is possible via [LDAP](../ldap-directory/index.md) or [local user](creating-a-local-user.md).

If you are using the [i-doit Add-on API](../../i-doit-add-ons/api/index.md#authentication-and-authorization), you need a [local user](creating-a-local-user.md) for authentication.<br>
Also you need the [API Token](../../i-doit-add-ons/api/index.md#authentication-and-authorization), which is for identify the [tenant](../../system-administration/multi-tenant.md) you want to login.
