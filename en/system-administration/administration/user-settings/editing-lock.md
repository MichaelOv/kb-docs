# Editing lock

The lock function for objects causes a lock for write accesses for the time of editing an object by any user.
At this time, the object can not be edited by another session (login of another person). The lock remains until the edit procedure is completed or the timeout is reached.

| Option | Value |
| - | - |
| Activate locking of objects in edit mode | Yes or No |
| Timeout | 120 Value in seconds |
| Currently locked objects | List of objects or none |
